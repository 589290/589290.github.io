Rank 2 is not twice as much as rank 1, rank 3 is not 1.5 more than rank 2. Instead, we need to use dummy variables to encode rank, splitting the data into four new columns encoded with ones or zeros. Rows with rank 1 have one in the rank 1 dummy column, and zeros in all other columns. Rows with rank 2 have one in the rank 2 dummy column, and zeros in all other columns. And so on.\n",

Since the GRE and GPA values are fairly large, we have to be really careful about how we initialize the weights or the gradient descent steps will die off and the network won't train.

To compensate for this, you'd need to use a quite small learning rate. Instead, we can just divide by the number of records in our data, mm to take the average. This way, no matter how much data we use, our learning rates will typically be in the range of 0.01 to 0.001.

So, we'll initialize the weights from a normal distribution centered at 0. A good value for the scale is $1/\\sqrt{n}$ where nn is the number of input units.

    "From this example, you can see one of the effects of using the sigmoid function for the activations. The maximum derivative of the sigmoid function is 0.25, so the errors in the output layer get reduced by at least 75%, and errors in the hidden layer are scaled down by at least 93.75%! You can see that if you have a lot of layers, using a sigmoid activation function will quickly reduce the weight steps to tiny values in layers near the input. This is known as the vanishing gradient problem. Later in the course you'll learn about other activation functions that perform better in this regard and are more commonly used in modern network architectures."
